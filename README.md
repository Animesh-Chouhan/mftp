[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Get emails when T&P stuff changes on IIT KGP's ERP.

## Setup

Deploy to Heroku and set config variables.

## WTF

mftp checks your ERP account for updates to the T&P companies list, and sends you an email if there are any new companies added to the list. Your credentials are stored as Heroku config variables, and you run your own Heroku instance.

## TODO

- Add keyword based updates for the notice board

## License
